                <p>lighting does not need to be static; the dynamic nature of the data can be taken into
                    account as well. A time-dependent lighting can facilitate understanding the evolution
                    of data over time. The interaction of the lighting with the scene can be used to model
                    the interaction of the data with an external agent.

                    Glyphs can be shown at various levels of detail (LOD). The LOD can be adjusted
                    to provide the analyst with the right amount of information for the task he has to perform.
                    The LOD can be related to the number of triangles used to represent the glyph in a surfacebased representation or by the resolution of the basic volumetric element in a volumetric
                    representation. A low LOD glyph can be seen as a sketch of the situation while a high
                    LOD glyph corresponds to a more detail representation. It is important to point out that
                    each glyph can have a different LOD in the scene.

            <div>
                <p>
                    The LOD can be increased by either adding more details to the structure of the glyph
                    or by repeating the structure of the glyph when a scaling operation is performed; this is
                    equivalent to using a fractal representation for the glyph. A fractal is an object that can
                    repeat itself at different scales or LOD. The object does not necessarily repeat itself in
                    an identical fashion at each scale; random variations are allowed. The fractal behavior
                    is usually valid only on a certain range of scales. Fractal structures are very useful for
                    representing data that have a high degree of auto-similarity at various levels, like
                    organizational data. By varying the number of levels on which the symmetry is valid, it
                    is possible to determine whether or not it is suitable to repeat a structure or a behavior
                    within an organization.

                    Not only can three-dimensional representations be used to model data efficiently,
                    but they can also be utilized to model interrelations. The fractal structure described
                    above is an interesting example. It is also possible to utilize complicated graphs like the
                    octree and the cone diagram, to mention but a few. Although these graphs can be very
                    useful, they must be utilized with great care because they can rapidly become difficult
                    to visualize. A possible solution to this problem is to transpose the data into another
                    context. The basic idea is to map the data space, which can be very abstract, to a wellknown problem that can be easily visualized and understood. That kind of paradigm is
                    called a metaphor. The metaphor maps the problem space into a space familiar to the
                    analyst called the “metaphoric space.” There must be a one-to-one correspondence
                    between the real space and the metaphoric space. The reason for this is that if a pattern
                    is found in the metaphoric space, the transformation must be invertible in order to find
                    the corresponding pattern in the real space.

                    Attempts have been made to use more than three geometric dimensions at once by
                    continuously showing subsets of the higher dimension space;dimensions are sampled
                    at random and displayed to the analyst at regular time intervals. Even though these
                    systems are of great interest from a research point of view, they have proved to be very
                    difficult to use, because the computing load is very high and can only be handled by highend computers, and because it is very difficult for the analyst to make sense of all the
                    subsets that are shown to him. It is clear that classical visualization paradigms are not
                    suited to those systems. However, computers that are more powerful and new visualization paradigms should open the door to multidimensional data mining.

                <h2>Virtual Reality and Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    Three-dimensional visualization can be made more efficient by the use of virtual
                    reality (VR) (Hoffman & Grinstein, 2001). It is commonly admitted that a virtual
                    environment (VE) is a three-dimensional environment characterized by the fact that it is
                    immersive, interactive, illustrative, and intuitive.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The fact that the environment is immersive is of great importance in data mining. In
                    an image, one looks at the data from outside, while in a VR environment the user is part
                    of the data world. This means that the user can utilize all his senses in order to navigate
                    and understand the data. This also implies that the representation is more intuitive. VR
                    is particularly well adapted to representing the scale and the topology of various sets
                    of data. That becomes even more evident when stereo visualization is utilized. Stereo
                    vision allows the analyst to have real depth perception. This depth perception is
                    important to estimate the relative distances and scales between the glyphs. Such
                    estimation can be difficult without stereo vision if the scene does not correspond to the
                    paradigms our brain is used to processing. In certain cases, the depth perception can
                    be enhanced by the use of metaphors.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    If more than three dimensions are required, more dimensions can be added locally
                    by inserting an image or a graph at a specific position in the VR world. Dimensions can
                    also be added by modifying the lighting conditions. It is also possible to add more
                    dimensions by using feedback or haptic devices (Burdea, 1996). These devices can be
                    very useful if the user interacts with the data. The force applied by the haptic device to
                    the user simulates the difficulty of performing a given operation on the data. Color and
                    texture can be used as well to represent additional dimensions or to enhance specific
                    features within the VR world.

                    Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs ) (Churchill, Snowdon & Munro, 2001;
                    Singhal et al., 1999) can be considered as a major breakthrough in data mining. By
                    analogy, they can be considered the equivalent of collaborative agents in visualization.
                    Traditionally, one or more analysts perform visualization at a unique site. This operational model does not reflect the fact that many enterprises are distributed worldwide and
                    so are their operations, data, and specialists. It is consequently impossible for those
                    enterprises to centralize all their data mining operations in a single center. Not only must
                    they collaborate on the data mining process, which can be carried out automatically to
                    a certain extent by distributed and collaborative agents, but they must also collaborate
                    on visualization and on the visual data mining aspect.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    CVE allows these enterprises to work on data originating from various sources and
                    to analyze them simultaneously from various physical locations. Each location has its
                    own VE. For most CVEs, the VEs do not need to be of the same type; one VE could be
                    a workstation, another a tiled wall display (Cruz-Neira, Sandin & Defanti, 2000), and the
                    third one could be a surround screen environment like a CAVE<sup>TM</sup>(Cruz-Neira et al., 1993).
                    The VEs can exchange data, video, and sound. All data can be accessed and manipulated
                    from all VEs simultaneously. If needed, a monitor can ensure that the VEs do not apply
                    conflicting manipulations to the data.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Note that it is important to choose the VE that is best adapted to the data and their
                    analysis. Graphical workstations are perfect for simple data sets analyzed by a few
                    specialists. Tiled wall displays are made up of a set of flat panels with liquid crystal
                    displays (LCDs) that are carefully aligned on a flat or a curved surface. They usually
                </p>

                    cover a very large area and consequently allow many specialists to work on the same data
                    simultaneously. Surround screen environments are usually made up of many surfaces.
                    Each surface is either a titled wall display or a projection surface. Surround screen
                    environments are used to achieve an optimum level of immersion. For many technical
                    reasons, the projector is based on digital micromirror device technology or DMD (Digital
                    Light Processing, <a href="http://www.dlp.com">http://www.dlp.com</a>). Stereo vision can be achieved by alternatively
                    projecting the left-eye and right-eye views and by synchronizing the rendering with
                    shutter glasses. Stereo vision can also be achieved by simultaneously projecting
                    polarized right-eye and left-eye views on the screen. In that case, passive polarized
                    glasses replace the active synchronized glasses. It should be noted that a metallic screen
                    must be utilized to preserve the polarization. The polarization system has a refreshing
                    rate that is twice the refreshing rate of the corresponding shutter system. A high
                    refreshing rate is suitable in order to avoid tiredness and VR-sickness. Since data mining
                    usually involves long sessions, the polarization-based system is the most suitable.

                <h2>Multimedia Data Mining and VR</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the past decades, data mining has mostly been applied to alphanumerical data.
                    Data mining is also applied to multimedia data, but most of the time the data mining
                    process is restricted to the associated metadata and to the surrounding text. Multimedia
                    objects contain a huge amount of information. Their description is directly related to their
                    content and for that reason they are called “content-based.” Most of the time, the
                    descriptor is a feature vector that contains a set of abstract data representing the
                    characteristics of interest.

                    Multimedia data mining is currently in its infancy. For that reason, the discussion
                    will be limited to the description of the data mining of three-dimensional objects in the
                    context of the CAESAR<sup>TM</sup>Project and of the National Research Council of Canada’s –
                    (NRC) Cleopatra multimedia data mining system.

                    The CAESAR<sup>TM</sup>Project is an international project that involves the USA, Canada,
                    Italy, and the Netherlands. The purpose of the project is to collect statistical and
                    anthropometrical data about the worldwide population. The anthropometrical data are
                    made up of various measurements performed on thousands of individuals, as well as of
                    three-dimensional scans of their bodies. The statistical data contain information about
                    their perceptions, consumer habits, and lifestyle. The CAESAR™database is intended
                    for utilization mainly by the apparel and the transportation industries. The apparel
                    industry needs body archetypes to design clothes that fit the population, and the
                    transportation industry needs archetypes to design car interiors and seats in planes that
                    are suitable for its clients

                    In this project, clustering and filtering is used as a method to group individuals
                    within the population into clusters (Han & Kamber, 2001). That is, we use the clustering
                    data mining technique to find similar individuals within the population, based on an
                    archetype. An archetype is defined as a typical individual within a cluster. It should be
                    noted that an archetype is usually not the center of the cluster; it is an individual that
                    is statistically representative of the behavior of the population within the cluster. Note
                    that the archetype must be a real individual belonging to the database. Average and

                    median individuals usually lead to archetypes that do not exist at all in the general
                    population.

            <div>
                <p>
                    The clustering method is based on the description of the individuals as contained
                    in the Cleopatra system designed by the NRC. Cleopatra analyzes the body scans as
                    contained in the CAESAR<sup>TM</sup>database and subsequently generates a shape descriptor for
                    each one of them. The descriptor is an abstract and compact representation of the human
                    body. Cleopatra then loads the shape descriptors, and the anthropometrical and statistical data into an Oracle8i™database. An object-oriented-relational representation has
                    been adopted for the data. The Cleopatra Search Engine can query the database by
                    human shape, anthropometrical data, and statistical data.

                <p>
                    Given a subject and some of his characteristics, like weight, the Cleopatra Search
                    Engine retrieves similar bodies from the database. The alphanumerical data act as a filter;
                    bodies that meet the filter requirements are accepted, while bodies that do not meet the
                    requirements are rejected. Once the filtering process is completed, the search engine
                    retrieves similar bodies based on their 3-D shape. The outcome of the retrieval operation
                    is a cluster corresponding to the proposed subject. By reiterating the process, it is
                    possible to validate the cluster and to find the right archetype. More details can be found
                    in Paquet, Robinette, and Rioux (2000) and The Caesar<sup>TM</sup>Project (<a href="http://www.sae.org/
                    technicalcommittees/caesumm.htm">http://www.sae.org/
                    technicalcommittees/caesumm.htm</a>), and a demonstration of the system can be found at
                    the NRC’s web site(<a href="http://www.cleopatra.nrc.ca">http://www.cleopatra.nrc.ca</a>). Once the cluster has been characterized, it can be visualized by using a VE; the archetype occupies the center of the visual
                    field while the various individuals belonging to the cluster are distributed around the
                    archetypes according to their similarity. In order not to bias the visualization process,
                    the individuals can be subjected to a random motion on spherical trajectory of constant
                    radius, the radius being related to the degree of similarity.

                    The ViziMine tool provides a comprehensive visualization tool to support the
                    cooperative data mining process. This tool gives the user the ability to visualize the data
                    and the data covered by the rules in various ways in order to understand it, and to gain
                    new insight into the data mining process. The ability to visualize the results of the data
                    mining effort, both during individual and cooperative learning, helps the user to
                    understand and trust the knowledge embedded in it. The tool thus gives the user the
                    ability to get an intuitive “feel” for the data and the rules created. This ability can be
                    fruitfully used in many business areas, for example, for fraud detection, diagnosis in
                    medical domains, and credit screening, among others.

                    Recall that the user is modeled as one of the participants in the CILT cooperative
                    data mining environment, as visualized by the ViziMine tool. The visualization process
                    is chronological, following the data mining life cycle, and is thus intuitive, easy to use,
                    and understandable (Multiple Authors, 2000). ViziMine provides a mechanism to enable
                    the user to monitor the data mining process, its inputs, and results, and to interact with
                    the cooperative data mining process and influence the decisions being made. In this way,

                    Future development of the ViziMine tool will include the study of a suitable
                    visualization technique for a variety of data set sizes and types, as well as an investigation
                    into the scalability of our approach. This will allow the tool to be compatible with
                    additional real-world data mining problems. The use of our approach for Web mining, with
                    the subsequent application thereof for e-commerce and e-business, should be further
                    investigated. Recall that current implementation of the ViziMine tool incorporates the
                    C4.5, CN2, and ANNSER data mining tools. Other data mining tools may be incorporated
                    through the transformation of their outputs to DNF rule format. This aspect will be further
                    investigated.

                    Virtual reality and virtual collaborative environments are opening up challenging
                    new avenues for data mining. There is a wealth of multimedia information waiting to be
                    data mined. In the past, due to a lack of proper content-based description, this
                    information was neglected. With the recent advent of a wide variety of content-based
                    descriptors and the MPEG-7 standard to handle them, the fundamental framework is now
                    in place to undertake this task. Virtual reality is perfectly adapted to manipulate and
                    visualize both data and descriptors. VR is also perfectly adapted to analyze alphanumerical
                    data and to map them to a virtually infinite number of representations.

                    VE<sub>s</sub> are intuitive and, as such, can help specialists to efficiently transfer their
                    analysis to upper management. Data are distributed worldwide and enterprises operate
                    from various remote locations. These enterprises have a huge amount of data but they
                    lack the right framework to convert them into a valuable asset. Collaborative virtual
                    environments provide a framework for collaborative and distributed data mining by
                    making an immersive and synergic analysis of data and related patterns possible.
